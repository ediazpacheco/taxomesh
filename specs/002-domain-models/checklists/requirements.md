# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Domain Models

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 10 checklist items pass on first validation pass.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed; all field shapes, constraints, and defaults were fully specified in the feature input.
- Scope is explicitly bounded: uniqueness enforcement and referential integrity are called out as repository-layer concerns, not model-layer concerns.
- Assumptions section documents the intentional use of open-typed metadata and the meaning of `Item.enabled`.
